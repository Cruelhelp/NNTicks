Based on our initial discussions and the progress we’ve made, here’s a full Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) tailored to your `NNTicks` project. Since we didn’t explicitly outline an SDLC at the start, I’ll reconstruct it from our conversations, your goals (a sleek trading app with NN/RF predictions), and the phases we’ve implicitly followed or planned. We’re currently in Phase 5, so this reflects both completed work and future steps, assuming a standard iterative SDLC (e.g., Agile-like with phases).

### SDLC for NNTicks

#### Project Overview
- **Objective**: Build a sleek, modern trading app (`NNTicks`) that streams live ticks from Deriv’s R_10 index, predicts rise/fall using Neural Networks (NN) and Random Forest (RF), and provides a GUI with real-time charts, predictions, and trade outcomes.
- **Tools**: Python 3.10, PyQt6 (with Qt5Agg fallback), `matplotlib`, `websocket-client`, `numpy`, `sklearn`.
- **Key Features**:
  - Live tick streaming via WebSocket.
  - NN and RF predictions with adjustable tick counts (1-5) and modes (Frequent: >0.5, Strict: >0.7).
  - Dark-themed GUI with live charts, trade history, and controls.
  - Training on live outcomes for adaptive predictions.
  - Alerts and polished UX.

#### Phase 1: Requirement Analysis (Completed)
- **Duration**: Implicitly done in early chats (March 23, 2025).
- **Activities**:
  - Defined core functionality: Stream ticks, predict rise/fall, display in GUI.
  - Identified data source: Deriv API (R_10 index) via WebSocket.
  - Set tech stack: Python, PyQt6, `matplotlib`, NN/RF models.
  - Established initial goals: 3-tick predictions, confidence-based alerts.
- **Deliverables**:
  - Basic requirements: WebSocket connection, NN prediction, 10-tick test.
  - Output: Initial `main.py` ran successfully (e.g., “Fall in 3 ticks [Confidence: 0.500]”).

#### Phase 2: Design and Prototyping (Completed)
- **Duration**: March 23, 2025 (post-initial run).
- **Activities**:
  - Designed modular structure: `config.py`, `data_handler.py`, `prediction.py`, `main.py`.
  - Prototyped WebSocket for live streaming (`data_handler.py`).
  - Outlined NN architecture (15-feature input, rise/fall output) and RF fallback.
  - Planned GUI integration for later.
- **Deliverables**:
  - Files: `config.py` (API token, settings), `data_handler.py` (live streaming), `prediction.py` (NN features).
  - Output: Live ticks logged, predictions every 10 ticks (later adjusted to strong signals).

#### Phase 3: Development - Core Functionality (Completed)
- **Duration**: March 23, 2025 (post-prototyping).
- **Activities**:
  - Implemented live WebSocket streaming with reconnection logic.
  - Added feature calculation (EMA, RSI, Bollinger Bands, etc.) in `prediction.py`.
  - Fixed NN to predict over 3 ticks, introduced Strict mode (>0.7 confidence).
  - Tested with `main.py` for 60 seconds, logging ticks and predictions.
- **Deliverables**:
  - Updated `data_handler.py` (timestamped ticks), `prediction.py` (mode support).
  - Output: Ticks streamed, predictions only on strong signals (though rare due to untrained NN).

#### Phase 4: Development - GUI Integration (Completed)
- **Duration**: March 23, 2025 (post-core functionality).
- **Activities**:
  - Built `gui.py` with PyQt6: dark theme, live chart, tick count selector.
  - Integrated WebSocket and predictions into a `TickWorker` thread.
  - Switched to `qt5agg` due to `matplotlib`’s missing `qt6agg` backend.
  - Added basic outcome tracking (win/loss).
- **Deliverables**:
  - `gui.py`: Live chart, status bar, Rise/Fall tab.
  - Output: GUI runs, plots ticks, shows predictions >0.7 (e.g., “Rise in 3 ticks [Confidence: 0.xxx]”).

#### Phase 5: Development - Training and UI Enhancement (In Progress)
- **Duration**: March 23, 2025 (current).
- **Activities**:
  - Added NN training on outcomes in `prediction.py`.
  - Enhanced RF to train after 50 samples.
  - Updated `gui.py`: Trade history, mode selector (Frequent/Strict), chart markers (entry/exit), start/stop button.
  - Tested live training and UI updates.
- **Deliverables**:
  - Updated `prediction.py`: Training logic, history buffer.
  - Updated `gui.py`: Polished UI with history, controls.
  - Output: GUI shows trades (e.g., “Outcome: Rise from 6088.123 to 6088.456 - Win”), trains models.

#### Phase 6: Testing and Refinement (Planned)
- **Duration**: TBD (next step after Phase 5).
- **Activities**:
  - Test prediction accuracy post-training (e.g., 100 trades, win/loss ratio).
  - Add audio alerts for predictions/outcomes (e.g., `playsound` or PyQt6’s `QSound`).
  - Optimize performance: Reduce RAM usage (check “Killed” issue), streamline plotting.
  - Refine UI: Add stats (win rate, avg profit), save/load model weights.
- **Deliverables**:
  - Test report: Accuracy metrics, bug fixes.
  - `gui.py`: Alerts, stats tab, model persistence.
  - Output: Stable app with audible cues, performance stats.

#### Phase 7: Deployment and Maintenance (Planned)
- **Duration**: TBD (post-testing).
- **Activities**:
  - Package app: Create executable (e.g., `PyInstaller`) for your M4800 or others.
  - Document usage: README with setup/run instructions.
  - Monitor live use: Log errors, tweak NN/RF hyperparameters.
  - Update: Add new features (e.g., multiple symbols, backtesting).
- **Deliverables**:
  - `NNTicks` executable.
  - Documentation.
  - Maintenance plan: Bug fixes, feature requests.

### Current Status
- **Phase 5**: You’ve got a working GUI with live ticks, predictions, and basic outcomes. Training is implemented but untested long-term.
- **Next**: Finish Phase 5 by running it long enough to train models (50+ trades), then move to Phase 6 for testing and polish.
